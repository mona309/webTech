    declared usuign :
        1.var — The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed 
        within  a  function.  Variables  defined  with  var  move  to  the  top  when  the 
        code is executed. 
        2.  const — Cannot be reassigned and not accessible before they appear 
        within the code. 
        3.  let — Similar to const, the let variable can be reassigned but not re- 
        declared.
    datatypes-
        primitive- number str bool nll undef
        non primi (with new keyword)-object number str date arr bool 
            eg -
            new Object();
            var accno = new Array(5);
            var nm= new String ("asb");
        almost everything is an object - date math reg expre arrat func always objects
    operators-
        samesame
        overloading/overriding
        + concatenates if even 1 is string
    constructs if else while for switch case
